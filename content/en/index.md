# Hi, I'm Marcus! ðŸ‘‹

I work as a Full Stack Developer at [tetraeder.com gmbh](https://www.tetraeder.com), where Iâ€™m involved in porting a large legacy system to Symfony, integrating AI into our products, and the soon-to-launch WordPress websites.

I live in Cologne with my wife and two wonderful kids, and I spend a lot of my free time diving deep into software architecture and development.

You might be a little surprised, but yes: this really is my website (for now)!

At the moment, Iâ€™m working on my own Static Site Generator called [HexaSite](https://github.com/marcuskober/HexaSite) just for fun, and this website reflects the current state of the toolâ€™s development. Iâ€™m also writing a series of articles about building a Static Site Generator with Symfony. The first article is currently only available in German, but the English translation is coming soon.
